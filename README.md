## Environment

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` for all endpoints.

## Notes

This service now uses the official OpenAI Go SDK v2 for chat, images, speech synthesis, and transcription.

## Docker Compose

Run the API with Docker Compose (uses `docker-compose.yml`):

1. Create an `.envrc` (or `.env`) file in the project root (loaded via `env_file`). Example:

```
API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3=https://s3.amazonaws.com
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

2. Start the service:

```
docker compose up --build
```

3. Access the API at `http://localhost:8080`.
4. Generated audio files appear in `./data` (mounted into the container at `/data`).

To rebuild after code changes:

```
docker compose build app && docker compose up -d
```
